# gogitvers

## What is this?

__A tool to extract version info from Git repo at build time__

Freely inspired from https://github.com/jeromerg/NGitVersion
but I wanted something that could be a standalone binary without any dependency.

Go was the perfect language for that.

## How does it work

Just run the *gogitvers* binary as part of you build script and it will generate a header file that you can include in your C/C++ project.
> ./gogitvers ../gpghelper > version.h

## What will I get

Something like this:
```C
/**
* gogitvers.h: file containing version identification constants
*
* THIS FILE HAS BEEN AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED, PLEASE DO NOT MODIFY
* Generated by GoGitVers, visit https://github.com/thew44/gogitvers
* Mathieu ALLORY (c) 2020, Under MIT license.

```
